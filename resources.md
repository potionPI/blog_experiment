This shall become a list of various resources which have been gathered over the course of this site's lifetime. The list should grow and grow, unless the site is abandoned. Topics will include anything that have been touched on during this site's lifetime.

*Pardon the lack of links, I just recently set this thing up.*

### **Language**: 
As of now, there are no links, but there should be in a little while.

### **GitHub**: 
As of now, there are no links, but there should be in a little while.

### **Earth**: 
As of now, there are no links, but there should be in a little while.

<br><br><br>*...some other topics should be added in as I prepare to repackage and gather more materials.*
