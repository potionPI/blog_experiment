Tonight, at 4:45 AM, the first words of the first post have been typed. These posts shall hardly be enough to warrant a pretty newspaper-style theme as the one which I've chosen, but given how beautiful the theme is, I have not changed to another more suitable theme.

I intend to collect many resources here of the hobbies which interest me. The night is short, and I must sleep, so the first material which I will collect will not show up until after the sun rises. For now, I will retire to bed.
