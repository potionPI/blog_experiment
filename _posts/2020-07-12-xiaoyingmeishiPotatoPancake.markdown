<button class="button" value="Close Curtain" id="myButton1" onclick="change()">Close Curtain</button>
<div id="myDIV">
This is my DIV element.
</div>

<p><b>Note:</b> The element will not take up any space when the display property set to "none".</p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
var x = document.getElementById("myDIV");
if (x.style.display === "none") {
x.style.display = "block";
} else {
x.style.display = "none";
}
}

function change() {
var elem = document.getElementById("myButton1");
if (elem.value=="Close Curtain") {elem.value = "Open Curtain";elem.innerHTML = "Open Curtain";}
else {elem.value = "Close Curtain";elem.innerHTML = "Close Curtain";
}}
</script>
